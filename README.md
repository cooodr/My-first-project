This HTML file creates a sleek "MX PLAYER" video interface with a blue background and clean layout. It features a logo placeholder, a video container with rounded corners, and controls for Play/Pause, Mute, and volume adjustment. Styled with hover effects, it includes a sample video but needs JavaScript for full functionality.
